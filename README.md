# homeoffice-x86-router
Normally you don't need a x86 router at your home, you could just buy a commerical router , it has almost everything you need. However these type of routers has some limits. If you need extreme other additional features, you probably want to build your own router. <br>

# brea-metal vs Hypervisor
You could simply install the openwrt or other similar router OS to your machine. But since I've already spend that much money on it. Personally i'd like to burn all the resources. So I am going to use this machine not only as the a x86 routers ,but also play some other roles.  Eg, media center , Downloading center ,temp storage center , smarthome service , eg.
